# XPLR-AOA door opener demo

Simple demo using two XPLR-AOA Anchors and one Tag to simulate an virtual door opener. The simulated door will open when the two azimuth angles are within a specic range.

Works with serial port or UDP broadcast packets.

Compile the solution using Visual Studion 2017 or newer. Configure the application to use anchors connected over USB/UART or UDP.
